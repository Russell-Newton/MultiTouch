# Library demo

[Vue Quick Start Guide](https://vuejs.org/guide/quick-start.html#creating-a-vue-application)

## Prereqs:

1. Install node.js ver 16+
2. In cmd or terminal within the `librarydemo` directory:
```sh
npm install
```

## Development:

In order to see changes made live, run
```sh
npm run dev
```

In order to see a built version of the page, run
```sh
npm run build:run
```
This will run a build of the website, creating HTML, JS, and CSS from the Vue project, and will serve it with live-server.
